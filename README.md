I created this project with reactjs, bootstrap, font awesome and tons of other npm packages. 

It's a ticket checking web app... not fully functional yet. so don't put your credit card number in there... (if asked!!)

Oh, by the way. sign in with facebook doesn't work... there is some kind of problem with developer mode. i joined the meet session and they advised me to skip it. so yeah, it doesn't work because of facebook. not because of me... 

## So to run this project on your machine run the following command on your terminal: 
### `npm install`
### `npm start`
